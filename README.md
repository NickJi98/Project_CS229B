# Project_CS229B

Neural STPP package is modified from https://github.com/facebookresearch/neural_stpp.git by Chen et al. (2021, ICLR). The original files are suffixed with '_origin' under 'neural_stpp'.

Analysis codes and data files are under 'final_results', including: dataset ('data'), functions ('my_func'), sbatch job submission script, trained models with different setups, figures in the final report, jupyter notebook for analysis, etc.
